This directory can contain a set of initialization scripts (Python files) for the Python interactive window in 
Visual Studio. Feel free to add your own files to import modules, define functions, or whatever you like.

Whenever the interactive window for this environment is reset, each .py file in this directory will be 
executed in alphabetical order.

Visit http://aka.ms/ptvsdocs for more information about what interactive window functionality can be 
modified from these scripts.
